# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project uses HTML, CSS, Tailwind, React, JavaScript.
(Backend coming soon)

`Nodejs third-parties`:
cors,
dotenv,
express,
mongoose

`React Libraries`:
react-dom,
react-router-dom
react-dropzone

**To install dependencies**

- Run these commands in the main folder directory

```
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
cd frontend
npm install
cd..
```

**To run the servers**

```
npm start
```

**If that doesn't work to run**
Make sure to run this command in different terminal/command prompt sessions in the same directory.

```
cd backend
npm run dev
```

```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

As always, stay corny:)
