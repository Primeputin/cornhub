  "title": "Python is the best programming language.",
  "desc": "Python is the best programming language, and I will tell you why. Python is easy to learn, write, read, and debug. It has a rich set of libraries and frameworks for almost any task, from web development to data science. It is cross-platform, portable, and scalable. It supports multiple paradigms, such as object-oriented, functional, and procedural. It is expressive, elegant, and powerful. Python is not perfect, of course. It has some drawbacks, such as slow performance, indentation issues, and the GIL. But these are minor compared to the benefits that Python offers. Python is more than just a language, it is a community, a philosophy, and a way of life. Python is the best programming language, and I challenge anyone to prove me wrong.",

  "desc": "Boiling: Fill a large pot with water and salt, and bring it to a boil. Add the corn and simmer for 4 to 8 minutes, depending on how tender you like it. Drain and enjoy with butter and salt. Joke: Why did the corn stalk get mad at the farmer? Because he kept pulling its ears!\n\nMicrowaving: Place an ear of corn in a microwave-safe dish, with the husk still on. Microwave for 5 minutes on high, then let it stand for 1 to 2 minutes. Cut off the stem end and peel off the husk and silks. Joke: What do you call a corn that joins the army? Kernel!\n\nGrilling: Peel back the husks of the corn, but donâ€™t remove them. Remove the silks and brush the kernels with oil or butter. Pull the husks back over the corn and secure them with a string. Grill over medium-high heat for 15 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally. Joke: How do you make a corn dance? You turn up the beet!",
